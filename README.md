# Description
A simulation of Brownian motion by simulating individual water molecules around a circular protein. GPU was used to accelerate it due to an enormous number of water molecules.
# Aim
The aim was to verify follwing laws of diffusion:
⟨x²⟩ = 2Dt

Where:
- ⟨x²⟩ = Mean squared displacement
- D = Diffusion coefficient
- t = Time

Diffusion Coefficient Formula:
D = (k_B T) / (6πηr)

Where:
- D = Diffusion coefficient
- k_B = Boltzmann constant
- T = Absolute temperature
- η = Viscosity of the fluid
- r = Radius of the diffusing particle
